# Notes


## Onsite United Chevy 6:30-
- onsite to troubleshoot UDM. Ports on UDM were good, SFP port 49 on main switch 1 was dead. Swapped it out to port 52 and the link came back up
- UDM swap was not nessicary
- Before the onsite we noticed the DHCP pool was getting very full so we decided to split the wireless out to another subnet.
- I also pushed the ITSTechwifi to this site for technicians.
- Troubleshooting MDI devices. Re flashed them and set them up on the new wireless network. Connected the laptops to wifi first to connect mdi devices them re connected laptops to Lan
- Left some instructions with one of the other techs to get the last one connected (tech was on vacation )
- Got stopped to help with a slow pc on the way out the door. Laura's pc [[Desktop-N19MHH1]] is being extremely slow. No obvious problems left ir running a sfc scan.
