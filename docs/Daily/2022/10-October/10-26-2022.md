- Tunnel speeds look good Locis is still having performance issues across the tunnel. 
- PCAP analaysis on both sides show small transfers (444k on the report pulled from city side) and about 1meg pulled from the CPD side (that didn't cross the tunnel) 
- On city side we are showing alot of tcp re transmission (maybe 20-30%) when pulling a report across the tunnel
- On the CPD side the connection is requesting retransmission from 1-5% of the packets 
- MTU transmission size is extremely small, going to follow up with locus about possibly increasing this to improve throughput.
