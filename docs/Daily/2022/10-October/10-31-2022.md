## UCB Bank issue

- Contacted UCB tech support
	-  Wireshark showed SYN ACK packets going out for handshake but nothing returning
	-  CPD address was blocked on their end
	- Got them to white list and could access main ucbbank.com page
		- Secure cash management page still wasn't available
		- was able to determine it was serviced by a different server
		- Name resolution through forward lookup zones wasn't working 
		- contacted their tech support again to check the ip addresses for secure servers
		- They have a second domain ucbonline.com for secure services serviced by
			- 50.44.0.76, 12.147.49.11
		- Added DNS zone for ucbonline.com in dns to reflect this
		- NS lookup and tracert worked fine after this
		- still couldn't resolve page
		- support pointed out I forgot the www to prefix resolution to resolve websites
		- added a record for www prefix and everything came back to life.
	- Left a message with Julie to test/call back. Will follow up before end of day if she doesn't call back.
