# Notes


## Onsite United Chevy

- Static'd brad's laptop on the wifi network with a port profile on the switch.
- Still need to test then add the rest of the tech laptops to the static profile
- Printer didn't reset, some of the guys who weren't there when I fixed it just weren't connected.
	- Tested maya's lapotp it printed.
