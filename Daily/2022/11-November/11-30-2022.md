# Notes


## Onsite Home Instead Jerseyville

- Removed the old gen1 Unifi equipment and replaced it all with a new udm home
- Cloud key and jacksonville isn't showing in the portal so I couldn't get a tunnel open to that site
- IP address had changed on jersyville side so putting it back up blind wouldn't result in a connection
	- 199.48.141.205 is jersyville's external IP now
