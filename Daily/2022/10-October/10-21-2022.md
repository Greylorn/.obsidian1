# Notes


## Onsite 8:00-10:45 Macoupin County ESB

- Helped GTSI with networking at radio tower. Configured the edge router so the .15 network could talk out to the internet.
- Suggested replacement of switches to simplify the network and get things talking better/easier as the traffic is only working one direction right now (GTSI can't remotely manage the .15 network)
