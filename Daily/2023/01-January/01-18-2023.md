# Notes

## Reid Family Wellness

- checked out front desk pc, suspect vga port has some sort of short in it
- put a display to vga adapter on it and it has worked fine the whole time i've been here
- updated firmware on HP printer, had firmware from 2018 on it.
- Changed Dr. Reid's print drivers to the plc 6 version 
- Suspect HP printer might of been failing to come out of sleep as they had to re-boot it to get it to print anywhere  most mornings
- Dr Reid's pc is an i3 2xxx series
- it takes 10 minutes to boot
- Talked with them about plan upgrades/services offered at each tier
- Talked with the about letting us help them review their backup process even if they don't decide to with our backup solution
- looks like they're currently doing manual backups.
- Unsure if they're being stored off site/full metal/how many pc's etc
- I think their practice software is running off a standard pc acting as a server.

## IT Glue meeting

- No simple way to add notes

- Multiple clicks required to do anything, entry is not simple

- Ticket integration

               - No time logging

               - No edit access to tickets

               - Cannot make ticket about device from portal

- Mobile app seems to be read only

               - No photo upload

               - No way to interact with objects/edit configs

- Password manager doesn't have a 'personal' password folder must be associated with a company

               - Makes it unwieldy to manage and use personal passwords with the manager, one of the selling points for us.

- base configurations are not editable and customizable

- network associations are not automatic with imported data.

               - Items must be manually added/associated with the network object even if it has a matching ip/subnet for that device
