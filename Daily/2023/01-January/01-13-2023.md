# Notes

IT Glue Complaints:

- No simple way to add notes
- Multiple clicks required to do anything, entry is not simple
- Ticket integration 
	- No time logging
	- No edit access to tickets
	- Cannot make ticket about device from portal
- Mobile app seems to be read only
	- No photo upload
	- No way to interact with objects/edit configs
- Password manager doesn't have a 'personal' password folder must be associated with a company
	- Makes it unwieldy to manage and use personal passwords with the manager, one of the selling points for us.
- base configurations are not editable and customizable
- network associations are not automatic with imported data.
	- Items must be manually added/associated with the network object even if it has a matching ip/subnet for that device
