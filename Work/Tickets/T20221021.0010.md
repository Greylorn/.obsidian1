## Customer reported issue

No Sound

## Resolution

- Driver issue. Running snappy driver installer. ~10 missing drivers.
- pc went to sleep no one on site to finish
- Followed up [[10-26-2022]] finished driver install can see devices being plugged in and the sound trasmitting but monitor isn't receiving sound
- Someone is supposed to bring a set of headphones onsite to test the jack tomorrow and see if it might just be the monitor/cable that is bad.
