## Customer reported issue

- Chief messaged me to let me know that Karen was still complaining about the speeds on locis.
- Speeds at the PD are 100/15 we tested the tunnel at 1MB
- Advised speeds are advertised in bits not bytes and are a power of 10 slower than what might be expected (15mb = 1.5MB)
- Encryption will eat some of the speed, but support articles reference the max throughput of the unifi site to site tunnel to be ~700mb 
- Chief is going to make contact with Madison and see if they can bump the speeds.

## Resolution
